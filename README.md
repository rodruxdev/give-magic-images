# GiveMagic Images

GiveMagic is on the cusp of launching a new product.
Our customers have a large amount of images to manage, but rather than them buying software, we want to offer them a simple free application to manage those images.

GiveMagic Images is a web app build with Nodej.js, React.js and TypeScript to help consumers to manage the images.

## Instalation

To install the needed packages is important to run:

```bash
yarn install
```

On the root of the project and inside the `client` directory. The `client` directory has the frontend application.

# Running on dev mode

Run the command:

```bash
yarn dev
```

To start a developing environment for the backend project with Node on the root of the project.

Run the same command to start the frontend project with React inside the `client` directory.

# Running preview

To run the backend on a local environment run the following command on the root of the project:

```bash

To run frontend preview in local environment, first do a build of the frontend project. Inside the `client` directory, running the following command:
